# Release 0.1.5 (2025-12-16)

Patch release focused on dependency refresh, CI robustness, and a more complete release/signing workflow.

## Overview

- **Dependencies**: gofulmen v0.1.21 (brings Crucible v0.2.21 transitively).
- **CI root detection**: Stabilizes repository-root discovery in container runners by passing an explicit workspace boundary from CI.
- **Release automation**: Tag-triggered GitHub Release publishing plus a manual signing/download/upload workflow.
- **Tooling**: Align shell formatting with goneat v0.3.21’s `shfmt` args override so linting is deterministic.

> Note: `v0.1.4` was tagged but is effectively superseded by `v0.1.5` (release workflow config issue + no signing).

## Changes

### Dependencies

- gofulmen: v0.1.20 → v0.1.21 (includes Crucible v0.2.21)

### CI / Repo Root Boundary

- CI now exports `FULMEN_WORKSPACE_ROOT` (GitHub workspace) as a repository-root boundary hint.
- Config loader uses the boundary hint only in CI and still requires repository markers (`go.mod`, `.git`).

### Release Workflow

- Added a tag-triggered release workflow to publish build artifacts to GitHub Releases.
- Added manual helpers (download, sign, upload) to support offline/controlled signing.

### Tooling & QA

- Configured goneat shell lint to use repo-specific `shfmt` flags via `lint.shell.shfmt.args`.
- Re-formatted repo shell scripts and hook scripts to match the configured style.
