# Release 0.1.7 (2025-12-18)

Patch release focused on making release signing and publishing safer and more consistent across Fulmen projects.

## Overview

- **Provenance-first**: Manifest-only signing (minisign primary, optional PGP) for checksum manifests.
- **Safer staging**: All release artifacts are staged in `dist/release/` to avoid `bin/` footguns.
- **CI alignment**: Tag-triggered release workflow uploads the staged artifact set.

## Changes

### Release Provenance Workflow

- `make release-build` stages cross-platform binaries into `dist/release/`.
- `make checksums` generates dual manifests: `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA512SUMS`.
- `make verify-checksums` verifies both manifests against staged artifacts.
- `make release-sign` signs manifests with minisign (primary) and optionally PGP.
- `make release-export-keys` exports trust anchors into `dist/release/`:
  - `<binary>-minisign.pub`
  - `fulmenhq-release-signing-key.asc` (optional)

### Upload Safety

- `make release-upload` uploads provenance outputs only (manifests + signatures + public keys + release notes).
- `make release-upload-all` exists for fully manual artifact publishing.

### CI Release Workflow

- Tag-triggered GitHub Release publishing now uploads `dist/release/*`.

### CDRL Guidance

- CDRL guide now calls out refitting the `<APP>_…` signing env var prefix.
- Clarifies `env_prefix` values should include the trailing underscore.
