# Release 0.1.4 (2025-12-15)

Patch release intended to bump gofulmen and introduce initial release automation.

## Overview

- **Dependencies**: gofulmen v0.1.21 (Crucible v0.2.21 transitively).
- **CI stability**: Adds an explicit workspace boundary (`FULMEN_WORKSPACE_ROOT`) to prevent repository-root discovery failures in container runners.
- **Release automation**: First cut of a tag-triggered GitHub Release workflow.

## Notes

This tag is superseded by `v0.1.5`.

- `v0.1.4` was tagged, but the release workflow configuration needed a follow-up fix.
- Signing helpers were not yet included.

## Migration Notes

No migration required for template consumers.
