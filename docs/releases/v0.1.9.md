# Release 0.1.9 (2025-12-20)

Patch release focused on smoothing the release signing UX and improving CDRL clarity.

## Overview

- **Release UX**: Standardizes `release-*` target naming for dist/release checksums and verification.
- **Default flow**: Emphasizes downloading CI-built artifacts, regenerating manifests locally, signing, and uploading provenance only.
- **CDRL clarity**: Better guidance on which template files are safe to delete vs refit.

## Changes

### Release Target Naming

- Introduced `release-checksums` and `release-verify-checksums` for checksum generation/validation in `dist/release/`.
- Introduced `release-verify-keys` for verifying exported public keys.
- Kept deprecated aliases (`checksums`, `verify-checksums`, `verify-release-keys`) temporarily for compatibility.

### Release Checklist Defaults

- Default recommended signing path:
  - `make release-clean`
  - `make release-download`
  - `make release-checksums`
  - `make release-verify-checksums`
  - `make release-sign` (interactive)
  - `make release-export-keys`
  - `make release-verify-keys`
  - `make release-notes`
  - `make release-upload` (provenance-only)

### CDRL Guide Improvements

- Clarified “template-only” artifacts vs files to refit.
- Strengthened the template-residue scan to include env var prefix residue (`GRONINGEN_`).
- Listed common residue hotspots (CLI help strings, envinfo headers, tests/comments).

### Dependencies

- **gofulmen**: Upgraded to v0.1.25 (Crucible v0.2.26 transitively).
