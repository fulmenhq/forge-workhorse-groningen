# Release 0.1.3 (2025-12-01)

Patch release to pull in the latest gofulmen helpers and refresh transitive Crucible content while keeping the template ready for downstream CDRL use.

## Overview

- **Dependency refresh**: gofulmen v0.1.20 (brings Crucible v0.2.20 transitively) to pick up the newest helper improvements.
- **Version bump**: Template version set to `0.1.3`; build verified via `make build`.
- **Quality gates**: `make fmt`, `make lint`, and `make test` all pass for this release.

## Changes

### Dependencies

- gofulmen: v0.1.15 → v0.1.20 (includes embedded Crucible v0.2.20)
- Crucible: stays transitive through gofulmen; no direct dependency added

### Tooling & QA

- Ran `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make test`, and `make build` successfully.

## Files Modified

- `VERSION` — bumped to 0.1.3
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` — dependency updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — release documentation
- `docs/releases/v0.1.3.md` — this file

## Migration Notes

No application or configuration changes required. Downstream consumers only need to pull the new release; CDRL refits continue to rely on `.fulmen/app.yaml` for identity.
