# Developer Guides Index

This directory collects focused guides that expand on the main developer handbook. Start with `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for the canonical onboarding and workflow reference, then drop back here for deep dives on specific topics.

## Available Guides

- [Groningen Template Overview](groningen-overview.md) — comprehensive overview of template architecture, components, and integration patterns
- [Accessing Crucible Documentation via gofulmen](accessing-crucible-docs-via-gofulmen.md) — learn how to read embedded Crucible docs, schemas, and config shipped with gofulmen.
- [CDRL Guide](fulmen_cdrl_guide.md) — step-by-step template customization for downstream applications

As new processes stabilize, add additional guides here so the index stays the single stop for topic-specific references.
